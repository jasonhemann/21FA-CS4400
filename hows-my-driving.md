We hope you always feel comfortable letting us know how you think the
course is going, how you feel you are doing, and how we can improve or
help you do better. For various reasons a student may not always feel
comfortable giving this feedback directly. We still want to hear from
you! Send us an anonymous email. Any number of email providers will
let you register a new account from which you can sent email to [the
professor](mailto:jhemann@northeastern.edu) anonymously. If you don't
think you will need or want follow-up correspondence, then you could
even use a fully anonymous disposable temporary email address. A
variety of providers offer this service; [here is
one](https://www.guerrillamail.com/).
