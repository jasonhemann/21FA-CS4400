title: Why 10pm instead of midnight?
---

Some other, earlier courses apparently make homeworks due at
11:59pm---effectively midnight. Why do you not do this?

A recent piece I read made me re-think the notion and culture of
having up-to-midnight deadlines. I don't *want* to create an incentive
structure that encourages students to stay up until midnight to
complete their work. I prefer doing my part to make the time between
10pm and midnight your own to spend as you wish by not making that the
valuable "last minute" in which to accomplish homework. My reading
suggested that being intentional about how we design homework
deadlines and due dates can help meaningfully contribute to students
sleep schedule and overall well-being.
